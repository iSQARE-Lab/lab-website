## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research spans multiple interconnected domains within software engineering, focusing on understanding and improving how developers write, comprehend, maintain, and evolve software systems. We utilize real-world data to develop evidence-based solutions that enhance maintainability, security, and comprehensibility. Through empirical studies, tool development, industry collaborations, and educational innovations, we aim to support developers with practical insights and automated tools that are grounded in real-world relevance.
